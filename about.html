                <p>Hello! I am Angie, a certified yoga instructor passionate about helping people find balance and wellness through yoga.</p>
                
                <h3>Dear Lovelies,</h3>
                
                <p>
                    I am so grateful that you are here. Whether you are just beginning your yoga journey or have been practicing for years, 
                    this space was created for you—a place of peace, growth, and self-discovery.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yoga is more than just movement; it is a way of connecting deeply with yourself, finding balance in a busy world, and 
                    embracing every breath with intention. My teaching philosophy is simple: <b>Yoga is for every body.</b> 
                    You don’t need to be flexible, strong, or experienced. You only need an open heart and a willingness to show up for yourself. 
                    Here, there is no judgment—only gentle guidance, encouragement, and the freedom to explore at your own pace.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my classes, we focus on mindful movement, breathwork, and deep relaxation to help you release tension, build strength, and 
                    cultivate inner peace. Every session is designed to meet you where you are, offering modifications and support so you can feel 
                    comfortable and confident in your practice.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I first stepped onto my yoga mat during a time when I needed healing. It became my sanctuary—a place where I could breathe, 
                    let go, and just be. Through this practice, I found not only physical strength but also a deep sense of calm and clarity. 
                    Now, I share this gift with others, hoping to create a space where you can feel at home within yourself.
                </p>

                </p>

                <p>So, take a deep breath. You are exactly where you need to be. And I am honored to guide you on this beautiful path.</p>

                <p><b>With warmth and gratitude,</b><br> Angie</p>
